# The Wave Function Collapse

## Introduction

The Wave Function Collapse originated from [Maxim Gumin](https://github.com/mxgmn) in 2016 on his [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) and has been used in a variety of ways, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse?tab=readme-ov-file#notable-ports-forks-and-spinoffs).
In his repo, Gumin describes the algorithm in extended detail and its different varieties. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to implement the three different varieties, so I will instead talk about two of them in this introduction and present the last one I reproduced in the rest of this document. All three varieties share the same algorithm. However, the sampling method differs. So what is the Wave Function Collapse?

The Wave Function Collapse, or WFC for short, is a procedural map/dungeon generation algorithm that will generate maps based on an input. There are two different ways to sample the input, hence the variations. But I mentioned three variations, so is there a third sampling method? This algorithm is not only defined in 2D but also in 3D where the sampling method will be similar to its 2D Tile-Based sampling counterpart but will use "modules" instead of "Tiles". The 2D Tile-Based sampling and 3D variation work in a similar way, the 3D variation simply adds another dimension to the mathematical aspect of the algorithm.

I will describe this "Tile-Based sampling" further in my project. To conclude this introduction, I will describe the other sampling method I mentioned before, Bitmap or Texture sampling. Texture sampling, as the name suggests, samples Tiles from a texture given a number N. This number N will then be used to sample NxN pixels from the input Texture and create all possible NxN tiles from the Texture. The Tiles will be compared slightly differently than the Tile-Based generation, as the Tile-Based will actually pre-define which tile can connect to which other tile. The texture sampling will instead compare the pixels on the border to check for compatibility with other tiles.

### The Project

#### Tile-Based sampling
The First part of this project is a 2D Dungeon/Texture/Terrain Generator. It has a variety of [Uses and Implementations](#uses-and-implementations).
However its main usage is Terrain Generation.

The project was made in a C++ Win32 engine developed by a teacher at DAE of the university of Howest. This project was based on the [Python](https://github.com/CodingQuest2023/Algorithms) version of this function also presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRtrj6Pua2A&) by [CodingQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingQuest2023). This is also where the original sprites I used come from, although I have a different stylesheet that simplifies the code significantly when drawing with it.

The variety of the [Algorithm](#Algorithm) I used for this first project consists of defining all the available enum [Tiles](https://github.com/Howest-DAE-GD/gpp-researchtopic-DijiOfficial/blob/master/WaveFunctionCollapse/Assets/Tiles4.bmp) I can use. Then defining all the ```enum TileTypes``` that that will be used to connect tiles together. There can be multiple tiles per type eg: ```FOREST_N```, ```FOREST_NE``` and ```FOREST_NW``` tiles all fall under the ```FOREST_N``` ```TileType```. We also define ```enum Direction``` to link every tile to its neighbor(s) given a direction(s). It is not necessary but it simplfies the math for the algorithm when we need to loop through the neighbors. 
Finally we make a ```struct TileInfo``` containing a ```vector``` of ```TileType``` and ```int TileWeight``` that we will use in a ```std::map<TileName, TileInfo> TileRuleSet``` to define which ```TileType``` can connect to each ```enum Tile``` and give them weights to influence their pick rate. This structure can be viewed in the [EnumClasses.h](https://github.com/Howest-DAE-GD/gpp-researchtopic-DijiOfficial/blob/master/WaveFunctionCollapse/EnumClasses.h) file. It is the main disadvantage of this variety of the the [Algorithm](#Algorithm), it's straight forward as everything is predifined so it's not complicated to understand and visualize. However the complexity of the system can grow exponentially as we add more and more tile options, as well as taking longer to initialize than other methods.

#### Texture sampling
(not yet implemented) 

This version, also a 2D generator, will solve the issue of the complex initial setup of the map and enums by sampling everything from a Bitmap/Texture, trading initialization complexity for Texture and Pixels comparaison.

#### 3D generation
(not yet implemented)

This version, similar to the [Tile-Based sampling](#tile-based-sampling) Generates 3D terrain.

### Motivations
I have always been passionate about Algorithms, Math, Physics and Video Games and how they intersect each other. And the passion for this project started when I first saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY&) by [Martin Donald](https://www.youtube.com/@MartinDonald) back in 2020. I found the explanation absolutely fantastic and it scratched just the right itch by combining Algorithms, Games, Infinite Generation, Exploration and Possibilites as well as the potential for infinite replayability. One of my very first "complete" project [MazeRunner](https://github.com/DijiOfficial/2D-Grid-Game) also features an infinite amount of levels by generating new ones every time. So I thought I would explore what [The Wave Function Collapse](#the-wave-function-collapse) had to offer and it did not disappoint as well as being slighlty harder to implement than I orginally thought it would be making it all the more fun and intersting.

### Final result

## Algorithm
In the following paragraphs the terms "tile" and "module" are interchangeable. A 'tile' refers to a 2D image with dimensions Width x Height, while a 'module' refers to a 3D box with dimensions Width x Height x Depth containing a 3D asset. It's important to note that they don't necessarily need to be square or cubic, as long as the rule set prohibits overlapping tiles or modules. For the 2D version of this algorithm, you can decompose a Width x Height tile into multiple smaller square tiles, completing the rule set with these subset tiles. To avoid confusion, I will refer to Tile objects as 'Tobj,' distinguishing them from individual tiles. Tobj contains various values, including a list of available tiles it can choose from.

1. [Initialize the rule set](#1-initialize-the-rule-set)
2. [Find lowest Entropy tile object](#2-find-lowest-entropy-tile-object)
3. [Tile Collapse](#3-tile-collapse)
4. [Constriction](#4-constriction)

### 1. Initialize the rule set

To get started with this algorithm, you will need to do an initial setup based on the specific variation you are working on. For [Tile-Based Sampling](#tile-based-sampling), begin by defining all the tiles you will be using and establish the rule set that will dictate how the tiles connect to each other â€” in other words, specify which tile can connect to which. Create an array of Tile objects (Tobj) containing a list of available tiles and an entropy value. By default, the entropy will be set to the total number of tiles. Entropy represents the number of available tiles left to choose from after the constriction process (more on that later). Additionally, provide each Tobj with links to its neighbors, which will simplify the code later. I assigned a set of directions (N-E-S-W) to each Tobj and later defined how each direction identifies its neighbors in the array.

Here's the rule set for [Tile-Based Sampling](#tile-based-sampling) an extract from the [EnumClasses.h](https://github.com/Howest-DAE-GD/gpp-researchtopic-DijiOfficial/blob/master/WaveFunctionCollapse/EnumClasses.h), containing for every tile a set of possible type connections for every direction (neighbor) and weights.
```cpp
using TileNameToRulesMap = const std::map<TileName, TileInfo>;

```

The Initalization of the array of tiles and assigning neighboring tiles.
```c++
void WaveFunctionCollapse::Start(bool reset)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < m_WorldWidth * m_WorldHeight; ++i)
		m_TilesPtrVec.push_back(new Tiles());

	// Assign to every tile its neighbors (not necessary but it makes the code clearer in the algorithm)
	for (int it = 0; it < m_TilesPtrVec.size(); ++it)
	{
		const int posY = static_cast<int>(it / m_WorldWidth);
		const int posX = it % m_WorldWidth;

		if (posY > 0)
			m_TilesPtrVec[it]->AddNeighbor(Direction::NORTH, m_TilesPtrVec[it - m_WorldWidth]);
		if (posX < m_WorldWidth - 1)
			m_TilesPtrVec[it]->AddNeighbor(Direction::EAST, m_TilesPtrVec[it + 1]);
		if (posY < m_WorldHeight - 1)
			m_TilesPtrVec[it]->AddNeighbor(Direction::SOUTH, m_TilesPtrVec[it + m_WorldWidth]);
		if (posX > 0)
			m_TilesPtrVec[it]->AddNeighbor(Direction::WEST, m_TilesPtrVec[it - 1]);
	}
}
```

The private member of the tile objects (Tobj).
```c++
class Tiles
{
private:
	std::map<const Direction, Tiles*> m_NeighborsMap;
	std::vector<TileName> m_AvailableTiles{};
	int m_Entropy{ 35 };

	TileName m_TileName;
}
```

### 2. Find lowest Entropy tile object

Loop through all the tiles to find the ones with the lowest possible entropy.
```c++
std::vector<Tiles*> WaveFunctionCollapse::GetLowestEntropyTiles()
{
	//Set lowest entropy to the highest possible value and create an empty list of tiles
	int tilesLowestEntropy = TileRuleSet.size();
	std::vector<Tiles*> tileList;

	//Loop through all tiles
	for (const auto& Tile : m_TilesPtrVec)
	{
		const int tileEntropy = Tile->GetEntropy();
		
		//If the tile has no entropy, skip it because it is already collapsed
		if (tileEntropy <= 0)
			continue;

		//Reset the list of tiles if a tile with a lower entropy is found
		if (tileEntropy < tilesLowestEntropy)
		{
			tileList.clear();
			tilesLowestEntropy = tileEntropy;
		}
		
		//Add the tile to the list of tiles with the lowest entropy
		if (tileEntropy == tilesLowestEntropy)
			tileList.push_back(Tile);
	}

	return tileList;
}
```

### 3. Tile Collapse

To collapse a tile choose a random available tile choices left, you can use weights to influence the choice.
Clear the available tiles list of the Tobj and add the chosen tile.
Set the entropy to 0 because there are no more choices available.
```c++
void Tiles::Collapse()
{
    std::vector<int> tileWeightsVec;
    //Loop through all available tiles and get their weights from the TileRuleSet
    for (const auto& tile : m_AvailableTiles)
    {
        const auto it = TileRuleSet.find(tile);
        
        if (it != TileRuleSet.end())
            tileWeightsVec.push_back(it->second.m_TileWeight);
    }
        
    //Make a random choice based on the weights of the tiles by using a discrete distribution
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::discrete_distribution<> distribution(tileWeightsVec.begin(), tileWeightsVec.end());
    const int randomWeightedChoice = distribution(gen);

    //Use the random choice to set the tile
    m_TileName = m_AvailableTiles[randomWeightedChoice];
    m_AvailableTiles.clear(); 
    m_AvailableTiles.push_back(m_TileName);
    m_Entropy = 0;
}
```

### 4. Constriction

The constriction may not be the hardest step but it definitely is the hardest one to understand, in essence it is simply telling all neighboring Tobj of the one that was collapsed which tiles are now unavailable and continuing this processs until there are no more tile to constrict. It goes as follow:

1. set a bool Constriction = false
2. Create a list of all possible connections from available tiles list of the to the neighbor
3. Loop through a copy of the available tiles list of the neighbor
     - Check if the available tile has a connection that is in the list of possible connections (2.)
     - If not then remove the tile from the neighbor's list of available tiles as it's no longer a valid tile
     - Constriction = true
4. Update the entropy
5. return Constriction bool

```c++
// We take all the available tiles of the previous neighbor and add all the possible connections to the current tile
// We then check the opposite direction to get the original tile the current tile
// We now check that for every current tile available it can connect (possible connections) to the original tile (the one that was collapsed/constrained aka the previous neighbor)
// If it can't connect we remove it (tile from possible connections) from the available tiles and return true so we can propagate to (constrain) neighbor tiles
bool Tiles::Constrain(std::vector<TileName>& availableTilesVec, const Direction& direction)
{
    bool wasReduced = false;
 
    if (m_Entropy == 0)
        return false;
    
    // Add all possible connections from previous neighbor to neighbor(current tile) in given direction
    std::vector<TileType> connectorsVec;
    for (const auto& availableTile : availableTilesVec)
    {
        connectorsVec.push_back(TileRuleSet.find(availableTile)->second.m_TileTypesVec[static_cast<int>(direction)]);
    }
    
    // Invert the roles and now loop through a copy of the current tile's available tiles to compare connections from this tile to the previous neighbor
    const Direction oppositeDirection = static_cast<Direction>((static_cast<int>(direction) + 2) % 4);
    const std::vector<TileName> availableTilesVecCopy{ m_AvailableTiles };

    for (const auto& availableTile : availableTilesVecCopy)
    {
        // Find the possible connection from the current tile to the previous neighbor and
        // If it's not a valid connection then remove asciociated tile from the available tiles of current tile
        TileType possibleConnection = TileRuleSet.find(availableTile)->second.m_TileTypesVec[static_cast<int>(oppositeDirection)];
        
        const auto it = std::find(connectorsVec.begin(), connectorsVec.end(), possibleConnection);
        if (it == connectorsVec.end())
        {
            // The item was not found
            m_AvailableTiles.erase(std::remove(m_AvailableTiles.begin(), m_AvailableTiles.end(), availableTile), m_AvailableTiles.end());
            wasReduced = true;
        }
    }

    m_Entropy = static_cast<int>(m_AvailableTiles.size());
    
    return wasReduced;
}
```
![ConstrictionDemoGIF](https://github.com/Howest-DAE-GD/gpp-researchtopic-DijiOfficial/blob/master/WaveFunctionCollapse/Assets/ConstrictionDemo.gif)
### Complete function

1. Get a list of the lowest entropy Tobj (ignore tiles with entropy of value 0)
   - If the list is empty then all tiles have been collapsed and the generation is complete
   - return true
2. Choose a random Tobj from the list and Collapse it 
3. Create a stack and add the collapsed Tobj to the top
4. Loop while the stack is not empty
   - Pop the top Tobj on the stack and store it
   - Get the list of all available tiles from the Tobj *used later for Constriction
   - Loop throught all available directions or neighbors
     1. Get the neighbor in current direction and verify his entropy != 0
     2. Constrain the neighbor
     3. If there was a constriction push that neighbor to the stack to check its neighbors
5. return false
   
```c++
bool WaveFunctionCollapse::CollapseFunctionAlgorithm(int x, int y, bool isClicked)
{
	const auto lowestEntropyTilesList = GetLowestEntropyTiles();
	if (lowestEntropyTilesList.empty())
		return true;

	int index = (y / TILE_SIZE) * m_WorldWidth + (x / TILE_SIZE);

	// Choose a random available tile to collapse and push it to the stack
	Tiles* tileToCollapse = nullptr;
	if (isClicked)
		tileToCollapse = m_TilesPtrVec[index];
	else
		tileToCollapse = lowestEntropyTilesList[rand() % static_cast<int>(lowestEntropyTilesList.size())];

	tileToCollapse->Collapse();

	std::stack<Tiles*> stack;
	stack.push(tileToCollapse);

	// Propagate the constraints to the neighbors (remove all of the neighbor's unavailable tiles based on the previous neighbor)
	while (not stack.empty())
	{
		Tiles* currentTile = stack.top();
		stack.pop();

		// Get the available tiles and directions of the current tile
		std::vector<TileName> AvailableTilesForNeighborVec{ currentTile->GetAvailableTiles() };
		std::vector<Direction> directionsVec{ currentTile->GetDirections() };
	
		// Loop through all the nieghbors of the current tile
		for (const auto& direction : directionsVec)
		{
			Tiles* neighbor = currentTile->GetNeighbor(direction);
			if (neighbor->GetEntropy() == 0)
				continue;

			// If the neighbor was constrained*, push it to the stack. (If the neighbor had some tiles removed from his available tiles choices)
			// then add that neighbor to the stack so his neighbors can be checked
			// *see Constrain() implementation for more details
			if (neighbor->Constrain(AvailableTilesForNeighborVec, direction))
				stack.push(neighbor);
		}
	}

	return false;
}
```
You can now call the function every game tick or while the function return false call it again.

#### Complexity

To explain the complexity time of the algorithm I will quote [abetusk](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/126593/abetusk) from his [forum post on stackexchange](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/201794/how-fast-or-scalable-is-wave-function-collapse): 
"First, let's define N to be the number of cells and T to be the number of tiles. For example, Pac-Man has about 36 unique tiles (T=36) and has about 28Ã—31 cells (N=868).

In general, the upper bound is O(T<sup>2</sup>â‹…N<sup>2</sup>). In practice this probably can be reduced down to O(T<sup>2</sup>â‹…N).

We can't really do better than O(Tâ‹…N) because just to traverse all cells and remove all non-chosen tiles, we're already at Tâ‹…N. To see why it might be O(T<sup>2</sup>â‹…N<sup>2</sup>), we might be required to traverse the whole grid after a single tile removal to see if any tiles need to be removed from the given constraints.

In practice, we only have pairwise neighbor tile/cell constraints and so the "impact" of a single tile removal can be localized to only cells around impacted site."

## UI

- Start/Stop button: Toggles the generation on and off.
- Toggle generate on click: When enabled, will allow you to click on any uncollapsed tile to collapse it.
- Complete button: Will call the Wave Function Collapse until the generation is complete without rendering debug options.
- Reset: Well it... resets.
- Resize and Width x Height Textboxes: specify the size you want in the textboxes. Left = Width and Right = Height. Tiles are 16x16 pixels so each value represents 16 pixels. So 10x10 represents 160x160 pixels. When you have chose the size you want press the "Resize" button. It will call the "reset" function, resize and recenter the window as well as realign the UI.
- Speed slider: Doesn't slide properly but you can click where you want on the slider to specify the framerate of the app, which will slow down/accelerate the generation.

Here's a Quick Demo of the features:

![UIDemoGIF](https://github.com/Howest-DAE-GD/gpp-researchtopic-DijiOfficial/blob/master/WaveFunctionCollapse/Assets/UIDemo.gif)
  
## Uses and Implementations

I originally planned on making an introduction and history section on algorithms in video games and follow up with their [Uses and Implementations](#uses-and-implementations). Due to a lack of time and relevance for the scope of the lesson, I removed both sections. Instead, I will link to [mxgmn](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/commits?author=mxgmn)'s [Notable ports, forks and spinoffs](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#notable-ports-forks-and-spinoffs)' GitHub section on his [Wave Function Collapse Repo](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), which is kept up to date and already quite complete.

## Conclusion

Working on this project was a blast. It has been a while since I've been so passionate about a project that I could keep working on it day after day. I'm very satisfied with the results and will have to call it there, as I could keep working on it for much longer, likely because of my interests in generation algorithms and randomness. In fact I will definitely be comming back to implement the [Texture Sampling](#texture-sampling) and [3D Generation](#3D-generation) later!

There are likely some optimizations left, notably in the Constriction algorithm where tiles will check neighbors that have already been checked and have no possible constriction left. For the drawing function, every tile is redrawn every tick regardless of change. Modifying the redraw function to only redraw affected tiles would significantly improve its "Debug" generation, as you have seen that discarding the draw function every tick allows for almost instant generation. There are also some missing UI elements that I wish I could have added, as well as making the speed slider actually slide. An addition to allow the user to select which tile they want to add would allow fixing certain elements of the map. As the first project is compatible with tile fixing, it would allow fixing paths/mountains/lakes/rivers, etc., in places you want. The addition of weight customization within the application to allow for many more customizations and control over the generation. Finally, adding the ability to reset specific regions you want to redraw gives the user even more control over the generation.

In conclusion, I believe that, with some more work, this can very easily become a very useful tool for the creation and design of levels and dungeons.
